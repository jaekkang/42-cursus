To be, or not to be: that is the question:
whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take
arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end
hem? To die: to sleep; no more; and by a sleep to say
we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that
flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd.
To die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the
rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have
shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause: there's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life; for who would bear the whips
and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office
and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself
might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something
after death, the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller
returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have
han fly to others that we know not of?
